            I&apos;m a software engineer who thrives on building sophisticated
            systems from the ground up. Born and raised in South Africa, I
            recently moved to the UK to pursue new challenges and opportunities.
          </p>
          <p>
            My journey isn&apos;t your typical tech story. From composing
            electronic music to playing electric guitar, I&apos;ve always
            balanced the analytical with the artistic. This dual perspective
            shapes how I approach software engineeringâ€”with both technical
            precision and creative innovation.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I&apos;m not coding, you&apos;ll find me pushing my limits in
            various ways â€”from training for marathon majors to practicing
            handstands and exploring the vibrant arts scene. I bring this same
            energy and dedication to everything I do, whether it&apos;s building
            software or mastering a new skill.

            Life is about balance, and I dedicate myself to pursuing excellence
            across different domains:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Movement as Art:</strong> I approach movement as a
              holistic practice, inspired by methodologies like Ido
              Portal&apos;s. From handstand practice to tumbling and gymnastics,
              I explore the intersection of strength, mobility, and creative
              expression through movement.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Athletic Pursuits:</strong> An avid runner with the Cape
              Town marathon under my belt, I&apos;m now training for the world
              majors. This endurance work complements my broader movement
              practice, which includes calisthenics and weightliftingâ€”each
              discipline informing and enhancing the others.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Musical Background:</strong> My creative side comes alive
              through music production and electric guitar. I&apos;m always
              eager to connect with fellow musicians and explore live
              performance opportunities in the UK.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            These pursuits reflect my philosophy that mastery in any domainâ€”be
            it movement, music, or codeâ€”comes through dedicated practice,
            creative exploration, and an open mind to learning.

        <p className="text-foreground/80 text-lg">
          Based in Solihull and looking for opportunities in London, I&apos;m
          excited to contribute to meaningful projects while immersing myself in
